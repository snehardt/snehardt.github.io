        <h2>Bad Jokes</h2>
        <p>This is where I will put all of my jokes. I have a list of them as of right now, and I didn't want to copy and paste them all over quite yet. I do have a lot of jokes prepared, and will easily fill up the requirements of 600 word per page.</p>
        <p>My content of my page will just be jokes, and I can't  think of them all in a couple of days, so I will continue to find them so I have enough to fill all the pages. I thought it might be easier to do them all at one instead of trying to add many paragraphsd as of right now.</p>
        <p>The rest of the pages will have different categories of jokes. My categories include Bad Jokes, Puns, and One Liners. There will be one of those on each of the three pages coming on this site.</p>
